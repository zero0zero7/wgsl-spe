// A collection of factory functions for making DeadCodeFragment statements. These help to ensure that dead code
// fragments are only constructed in meaningful ways.
//
// An alternative design choice would be to equip DeadCodeFragment with preconditions ensuring that only certain forms
// of statement are created. The problem with that design, however, is that it would make further transformation of
// DeadCodeFragment statements problematic, as transformations that _would_ preserve semantics might not preserve the
// exact structure required by these preconditions, and the transformation process relies on being able to smoothly
// clone the AST with transformations in tow.
